1,Lakeland - Schiller Triangle Park,stop2.mp3,43.0900634,-89.3465332,"This is the only city designated park on this tour. The park offers very little as far as amenities and consists of a handful of trees and grass. The city measures the park as 0.09 acres of land.<sup>1</sup>  The park is named after the two streets that meet at its southern corner: Lakeland which is named for the proximity to Lake Monona and Schiller which is named for the German poet and playwright Christoph Friedrich von Schiller.<sup>2</sup> This neighborhood was initially park of as part of the Town of Fair Oaks which has been slowly absorbed by the City of Madison with the final piece scheduled to happen in 2027.<sup>3</sup> The park is present on a neighborhood map from 1969.<sup>4</sup><br>Despite the small size this park has been both a home for local wildlife like the pair of Eastern Screech Owls which nested here in summer 2022<sup>5</sup> and a civic space like with the Democracy in the Park event that allowed voters to complete and submit absentee ballots here in the 2020 election.<sup>6</sup> ",Begin your tour at the Lakeland-Schiller Triangle Park.,stop1.png
2,End of St Paul Ave,stop5.mp3,43.093432,-89.3492743,"This area has undergone some of the most recent changes of all of the tour stops. This area is situated at a busy intersection between Eastwood, Atwood, and Dunning. Looking north or uphill you will see St. Paul Avenue ending in a cul-de-sac. Through the middle of the intersection and along the sidewalk the blacktop with the dashed yellow markings, you’ll notice the Capital City Trail. Because of the busyness of the intersection and the mixing foot, bicycle, and car traffic, the Jackson Street and Ohio Avenue cross streets were each reduced to one direction, adding a light for pedestrian crossings, and reducing the width of St. Paul Street.<sup>1</sup><br>Looking at the map to the northeast, you will notice a blue rectangle. This rectangle represents the former village hall of the Village of Fair Oaks.<sup>2</sup>  The village was incorporated in 1906, and the building was dedicated in 1908. The village reached along the northeast side of Lake Monona and was later annexed by Madison and Monona.<br>This greenspace was improved by the SASY (Schenk-Atwood-Starkweather-Yahara) Neighborhood Association and is a city run park.<sup>3</sup> Beginning in 2015, the association in partnership with local businesses and the city worked to improve the usability of the place, based on how people were then using it. Take note of the blue urn and the mushroom statue. ",Cross Schiller Court  and follow it north to Evergreen Avenue and eventually to Atwood.,stop2.png
3,End of Eastwood Ave,stop7.mp3,43.0927775,-89.3509322,"This triangular patch is created by the recombination of Atwood and Eastwood as well as the tail end of Division Street. Looking across Eastwood, you’ll notice the Capital City Trail continuing from our last stop. You may notice the similar naming of Eastwood and Atwood as well as the fact that they form a couplet of one-way roads. Atwood was originally bidirectional, and the place where Eastwood runs was a set of railroad tracks.<sup>1</sup> The tracks were owned and operated by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific railroad, which began by just connecting Milwaukee to one of its suburbs, Waukesha, in 1851.<sup>2</sup>  By 1854, the railroad had connected to Madison and later expanded to Chicago and the Twin Cities as well as across the continent to Puget Sound, leading to the long compound company name. The company was often called just The Milwaukee Road. The railroad operated cargo and passenger traffic across these routes and created the well renowned <em>Hiawatha</em> trains. As the railroad industry consolidated, The Milwaukee Road became unable to compete and filed for bankruptcy in 1977.<sup>3</sup> After obtaining the right of way from the collapsing railroad, the city decided to reduce congestion on Atwood and create a bypass called Eastwood and develop this section of the bike path was part of a rails to trails project. Eastwood opened to traffic on November 7, 1974.<sup>1</sup> Eastwood and the bike path exist as a reminder of a more industrial past of the eastside of Madison.

4,Tiny piece of land at Schenk's Corner,stop6.mp3,43.0921857,-89.3552472,"This tiny piece of green space is certainly the smallest on the tour. This complicated intersection of Atwood and Winnebago is called Schenk’s Corner. The Schenk family opened one of the first businesses in the area in 1893.<sup>1</sup> The grocery store/saloon grew as well as the Schenk family. By the 1930’s the family had built a livery, dry goods store, and a hardware store. Notice the orange brick buildings across the corner (and marked on the map). These buildings were built by the Schenk’s to house their growing businesses.<br> Across the corner, notice the bank (also marked on the map). This building was built in 1923 to house the Security State Bank.<sup>1</sup> The bank was founded in 1912 by east side residents and served the local community. The current Lake Ridge bank is unrelated to the former Security State Bank and moved into the building in 2014.<sup>3</sup><br> This green space may have been here from the beginning of the Schenk’s developments. While researching, no information about its creation or current management could be located, and each map of that area noted the green space as existing. The earliest map located that included the area in detail was a 1902 fire insurance map where the angle can be seen denoted as empty area without any structures on it.<sup>2</sup>",Cross Atwood again and walk to the corner with Winnebago.

5,Triangle of land where Winnebago splits with Eastwood,stop3.mp3,43.0895288,-89.356886,"Located in the Shorewood Department of Public Works (DPW) yard on Morris Boulevard, these two large grey tanks have a combined capacity of 10,000 gallons. Installed in 2013, they collect rainwater to be used to maintain public plantings throughout the village. A one-inch rain can fill both of these tanks! ",Cross back across Winnebago and then Atwood.
